Summary:
A broadcast message is a message that is sent to all devices on a network or a subnet. 
A UDP socket is a type of socket that uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to send 
and receive data. UDP is a connectionless and unreliable protocol, which means that it 
does not establish a connection before sending data, and it does not guarantee that the 
data will arrive at the destination. UDP is useful for applications that require speed and 
efficiency, such as streaming media or online games.
• It creates a UDP socket using the socket.socket function with 
socket.AF_INET and socket.SOCK_DGRAM as arguments. socket.AF_INET
specifies the address family for IPv4 addresses, and socket.SOCK_DGRAM
specifies the socket type for UDP.
• It enables broadcasting mode on the socket using the setsockopt method with 
socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, and 1 as arguments. 
socket.SOL_SOCKET is the level at which the option is defined, 
socket.SO_BROADCAST is the option name for enabling broadcasting, and 1 is 
the option value for enabling it.
• It binds the socket to the specified port using the bind method with a tuple of an 
empty string and the port number as an argument. The empty string means that 
the socket will listen on all available interfaces.
• It tries to receive a broadcast message using the recvfrom method with 1024 as 
an argument. This method returns a tuple of the data and the address of the 
sender. The data is a byte object that needs to be decoded into a string using the 
decode method with ‘utf-8’ as an argument. The address is a tuple of the IP 
address and the port number of the sender.
• It prints the received broadcast message and the address of the sender using the 
print function and an f-string, which is a way of inserting variables into a string.
• It handles any socket error that may occur during receiving using a try-exceptfinally block. If an error occurs, it prints the error message using the print
function and an f-string. Finally, it closes the socket using the close method.
• It creates a UDP socket using the socket.socket function with 
socket.AF_INET and socket.SOCK_DGRAM as arguments. socket.AF_INET
specifies the address family for IPv4 addresses, and socket.SOCK_DGRAM
specifies the socket type for UDP.
• It enables broadcasting mode on the socket using the setsockopt method with 
socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, and 1 as arguments. 
socket.SOL_SOCKET is the level at which the option is defined, 
socket.SO_BROADCAST is the option name for enabling broadcasting, and 1 is 
the option value for enabling it.
• It defines the broadcast address as ‘127.0.0.1’, which is the loopback address 
that refers to the local machine. This means that the broadcast message will 
only be sent to devices on the same machine as the sender.
• It tries to send the broadcast message using the sendto method with the 
message encoded into bytes using the encode method with ‘utf-8’ as an 
argument, and a tuple of the broadcast address and the port number as another 
argument. The port number is 12345, which is an arbitrary choice that must 
match the port number of the receiver.
• It prints the broadcast message sent using the print function and an f-string, 
which is a way of inserting variables into a string.
• It handles any socket error that may occur during sending using a try-exceptfinally block. If an error occurs, it prints the error message using the print
function and an f-string. Finally, it closes the socket using the close method.
